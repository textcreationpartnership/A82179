            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AFter it had pleaſed God not onely to reduce <hi>Ireland,</hi> and give in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but ſo marvellouſly to appeare for his people at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> that thoſe Nations were reduced to a great degree of peace, and <hi>England</hi> to perfect quiet, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Parliament had opportunity to give the people the harveſt of all their labour, blood, and treaſure, and to ſettle a due Liberty both in reference to civill and ſpirituall things, whereunto they were obliged by their duty, their engagements, as alſo the great and wonderfull things which God hath wrought for them; it was mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of much grief to the good and well-affected of the Land, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the little progreſſe which was made therein, who thereupon applied to the Army, expecting redreſſe by their meanes: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, the Army being unwilling to meddle with the Civill Authority, in matters ſo properly appertaining to it, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, That his Excellency and Officers of the Army, which were Members of Parliament, ſhould be deſired to move the Parliament,

               <!-- PDF PAGE 24 -->
to proceed vigorouſly in reforming what was amiſſe in Government, and to the ſetling of the Common-wealth, upon a foundation of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Righteouſneſſe; which having done, we hoped that the Parliament would ſeaſonably have anſwered our expectation, but finding (to our grief) delayes therein, we renewed our deſires in an humble Petition to them, which was preſented in <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt: And although, they at that time, ſignifying their good accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance thereof, returned us thanks, and referred the particulars thereof, to a Committe of the Houſe, yet no conſiderable effect was produced, nor any ſuch progreſſe made, as might imply their reall intentions to accompliſh what was Petitioned for: But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, there more and more appeared amongſt them, an averſion to the things themſelves, with much bitterneſſe and oppoſition to the people of God, and his Spirit acting in them; which grew ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, that thoſe perſons of honour and integrity amongſt them, who had eminently appeared for God and the publick good, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and throughout this war, were rendred of no further uſe in Parliament, then by meeting with a corrupt party to give them countenance to carry on their ends, and for effecting the deſire they had of perpetuating themſelves in the Supream Government. For which purpoſe the ſaid party long oppoſed, and frequently declared themſelves againſt having a New Repreſentative: And when they ſaw themſelves neceſſitated to take that Bill into conſideration, they reſolved to make uſe of it to recruit the Houſe with perſons of the ſame ſpirit and temper, thereby to perpetuate their owne ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Which intention divers of the moſt active amongſt them did manifeſt, labouring to perſwade others to a conſent therein: And the better to effect this, divers Petitions preparing from ſeverall Counties, for the continuance of this Parliament, were encouraged, if not ſet on foot by many of them.</p>
            <p>For obviating theſe evills, the Officers of the Army obtained ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall meetings with ſome of the Parliament, to conſider what fitting means and remedy might be applyed to prevent the ſame; but ſuch endeavours proving altogether ineffectuall, it became moſt evident to the Army, as they doubt not it is alſo to all conſidering perſons, that this Parliament, through the corruption of ſome, the jealouſie of others, the non-attendance and negligence of many, would never anſwer thoſe ends, which God, his people, and the

whole Nation expected from them. But that this Cauſe which the Lord hath ſo greatly bleſſed, and bore witneſſe to, muſt needs lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh under their hands, and by degrees be wholly loſt, and the lives, liberties, and comforts of his people, delivered into their Enemies hands.</p>
            <p>All which being ſadly and ſeriouſly conſidered by the honeſt people of this Nation, as well as by the Army, and wiſdome and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection being ſought from the Lord, it ſeemed to be a duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon us, who had ſeen ſo much of the power and preſence of God going along with us, to conſider of ſome more effectuall means to ſecure the Cauſe which the good people of this Common-wealth had been ſo long engaged in, and to eſtabliſh righteouſneſſe and peace in theſe Nations.</p>
            <p>And after much debate it was judged neceſſary, and agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Supream Authority ſhould be by the Parliament, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved upon known perſons, men fearing God, and of approved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and the Government of the Common-wealth committed unto them for a time, as the moſt hopefull way to encourage and countenance all Gods people, reforme the Law, and adminiſter ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice impartially, hoping thereby the people might forget Monarchy, and underſtanding their true intereſt in the election of ſucceſſive Parliaments, may have the Government ſetled upon a true Baſis, without hazard to this glorious Cauſe, or neceſſitating to keep up Arms for the defence of the ſame.</p>
            <p>And being ſtill reſolved to uſe all means poſſible to avoid extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary courſes, we prevailed with about twenty Members of Parliament, to give us a Conference, with whom we freely and plainly debated the neceſſity and juſtneſſe of our Propoſals, on that behalfe: And did evidence that thoſe, and not the Act under their conſideration, would moſt probably bring forth ſomething an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to that work, the foundation whereof, God himſelfe hath laid, and is now carrying on in the world.</p>
            <p>The which notwithſtanding found no acceptance, but in ſtead thereof, it was offered, that the way was to continue ſtill this preſent Parl. as being that from which we might reaſonably expect all good things. And this being vehemently inſiſted upon, did much confirm us in our apprehenſions, That not any love to a Repreſentative, but the making uſe thereof to recruit, and ſo to perpetuate themſelves, was their aim.</p>

They being plainly dealt with about this, and told, That neither the Nation, the honeſt intereſt, nor we our ſelves would be deluded by ſuch dealings, they did agree to meet againe next day in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoone for mutuall ſat is faction, it being conſented to by the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers preſent, that indeavours ſhould be uſed, that nothing in the mean time ſhould be done in Parliament, that might exclude or fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Propoſals before mentioned.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this, the next morning the Parliament did make more haſt then uſuall in carrying on their ſaid Act, being helped on therein by ſome of the perſons engaged to us the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, none of them which were then preſent endeavouring to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſame; and being ready to put the maine Queſtion for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummating the ſaid Act, whereby our aforeſaid Propoſals would have been rendred void, and the way of bringing them into a faire and full debate in Parliament, obſtructed.</p>
            <p>For preventing whereof, and all the ſad and evill conſequences, which muſt upon the grounds afore ſaid have enſued, and whereby at one blow the intereſt of all honeſt men, and of this glorious cauſe, had been indangered to be laid in the duſt, and theſe Nations im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyled in new troubles, at a time when our Enemies abroad are watching all advantages againſt us, and ſome of them actually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in War with us, we have been neceſſitated, though with much relunctancy, to put an End to this Parliament.</p>
            <p>And deſire, That all men, as they would not provoke the Lord to their owne deſtruction, ſhould wait for ſuch iſſue as he ſhall bring forth, and to follow their buſineſſe with peaceable ſpirits, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we promiſe them protection by his aſſiſtance.</p>
